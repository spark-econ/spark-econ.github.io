-   [**Policy, Substance Abuse Treatment Access, and Overdose Deaths**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VXf55arawyFWBc3G6_rDj6AwoF2-5dvE/view?usp=drive_link)

**Abstract**: The Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA) expanded access to substance abuse treatment by extending insurance coverage and requiring plans to cover behavioral health services. This paper examines how the ACA affected the availability of residential substance abuse treatment (RSAT) facilities and how this expansion reshaped the broader treatment landscape. Using county-level data from 2004 to 2016, I apply difference-in-differences and event study designs to estimate the ACA’s supply-side effects through two channels: private insurance reforms and Medicaid expansions. I find that the number of RSAT facilities per 100,000 population increased by 24 percent in counties with low pre-ACA saturation and by 15 percent in Medicaid expansion states. I also show that counties experiencing RSAT growth saw declines in outpatient treatment availability, suggesting substitution across treatment settings. Moreover, growth was concentrated in areas that already had RSAT providers, with limited expansion into previously unserved counties. In supplemental analysis, I find no evidence that RSAT expansion was associated with reductions in fatal or nonfatal overdose outcomes. These results suggest that expanding facility counts alone may be insufficient to improve public health unless accompanied by geographically targeted access and stronger oversight of treatment quality.

-   **The Impact of Malpractice Information Shock on Physician’s Relocation Decision**

**Abstract**: Malpractice incidents, once disclosed, may carry reputational consequences not only for the physician involved but also for colleagues in the same practice group. This paper examines whether public disclosure of a malpractice incident triggers relocation among peers. I construct a provider-level monthly panel (2015–2021) by linking Medical Board of California records with the National Provider Identifier files and estimate event study and difference-in-differences models. Peer relocation rises by about 0.1 percentage points, an 11 percent increase relative to baseline, following disclosure. While relocation is uncommon, the effect reflects a delayed adjustment, with the largest increases occurring 25–30 months after disclosure and re-emerging later. No effect is detected in annual models, indicating responses are infrequent and inconsistently timed. Similar analyses for felony or misdemeanor disclosures show no effect, suggesting malpractice disclosures are uniquely salient within professional networks, even if their influence on relocation decisions is limited.

-   **The Effect of Building Affordable Housing on Student Mobility and Educational Spillovers**

**Abstract**: This project examines whether the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program improves residential stability for families with school-age children. Using administrative address records from North Carolina public school students, I construct a panel dataset and apply difference-in-differences and event study methods. Results show that both economically disadvantaged (ECD) and non-ECD students experience reduced short-term mobility after moving into LIHTC neighborhoods, which tend to be more affordable than other areas. However, it remains unclear how much LIHTC housing itself contributes to stability. Additional analysis of repeat movers shows that families often leave LIHTC neighborhoods for higher-income communities after relatively short stays.
