I am an applied microeconomist with research interests in health, labor, and public economics. My work examines how policies and regulations shape social and economic outcomes.

I am currently a Visiting Assistant Professor of Economics at Bowdoin College, and I received my PhD in Economics from the University of California, Riverside in 2025. I am also passionate about teaching and was honored with UC Riverside’s Distinguished Teaching Award in 2025.
