I am an applied microeconomist with a PhD in Economics from the University of California, Riverside. My research explores the intersection of health, labor, and public economics, focusing on how policies and regulations shape social and economic outcomes.

I am also passionate about teaching and was honored with UC Riverside’s Distinguished Teaching Award in 2025.

I am currently a Visiting Assistant Professor of Economics at Bowdoin College (2025–2026).
